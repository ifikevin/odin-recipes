        <h2>Description</h2>
    These are the best burgers I've ever had. My mother made a version of these and I changed it a little.
    Instead of jalapeno peppers you can add anything or just do the cream cheese. Trust me, 
    your family and/or guests will beg for the recipe! Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>8 (2 ounce) hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Stir together jalapenos and cream cheese in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Divide ground beef into 16 portions. Pat out each one to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>
        <li>Spoon some cream cheese mixture onto the center of 1/2 of the patties. Top with the remaining patties, and press the edges together to seal.</li>
        <li>Cook on the preheated grill until well done, about 10 minutes per side. Don't press down on the burgers as they cook, or the cheese will ooze out.</li>
    </ol>
